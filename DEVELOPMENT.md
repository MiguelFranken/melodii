# Getting started
You need [Node.js].

Install all the dependencies with
```
npm install
```

Then you can start the server and the frontend with
```
npm run start
```
Look at the console output to determine the URLs that you can connect to.

# Developing
In development, you might want to have everything running in the background and recompile automatically whenever you save a file. To achieve that, run
```
npm run watch
```

## Technologies
The project uses [Tone.js] ([API reference](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/14.4.79/Tone)) for producing sounds. The frontend is written using [Angular].
