# README - PI-CASE - building the case for the raspberry pi

If you want to build the case for the raspberry pi like we did it the only thing you need is a lasecutter and a bit of wood.

Import the svg files into the laser cutter programm and after cutting you 
just need a steady hand to connect the pieces.

Sometimes you have to emery the endings a bit so it fits better.
